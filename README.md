### Best Password Criteria:
- **Minimum Length**: Passwords should be at least 12 characters long for better security.
- **Uppercase Letters**: Adding uppercase letters increases the difficulty for attackers.
- **Numbers**: Including numbers adds to the complexity.
- **Symbols**: Symbols make passwords even harder to guess.

### Vulnerabilities of Passwords:
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Attackers try every possible combination until they find the right one. Longer and more complex passwords help protect against this.
- **Dictionary Attacks**: Attackers use lists of common passwords to guess. Using unique and complex passwords can help prevent this.
- **Phishing**: Users can be tricked into giving away their passwords. Unique passwords for different accounts can limit the damage.
- **Password Reuse**: Using the same password on multiple sites increases risk. If one site gets hacked, all accounts using that password are in danger.

### Issues with Different Types of Passwords:
- **Simple Passwords**: Easy to remember but easy to guess (e.g., "password123").
- **Complex Passwords**: Harder to guess but also harder to remember (e.g., "P@ssw0rd!").
- **Password Managers**: These can generate and store complex passwords, but if the manager is compromised, all stored passwords are at risk.
